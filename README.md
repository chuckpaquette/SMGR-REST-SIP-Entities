# SMGR-REST-SIP-Entities
Postman code for visualization of the data structure returned by SMGR SIP entity REST request 

I use Postman to test REST requests to Avaya System Manager (SMGR). I have created this GIT repository to record the Java script that I dropped into the tests tab of Postman

Using REST URI Request:
https://<system-manager-dns>/NRP/admin/sipentities

Make sure the authorization tab on Postman in filed out with the proper SMGR user

Add/Change the Accept Header to the value: application/json
